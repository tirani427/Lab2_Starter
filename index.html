        <p>
          In the previous meeting, there was a bit of professional discourse between <i>Hiccup and his father</i>, specifically on how to incorporate the dragons into everyday life.
          There was also the case of building specific facilities in order to accomodate the differing needs between dragons and humans. Such as:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Dragon Pens</li>
          <li>Saddle-Making</li>
          <li>Notes:
            <ul>
              <li>Saddle-making will take place in the previous location for the armory.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Feeding stations.</li>
        </ul>
